# VBA-challenge

Notes on collaboration:
To double check my code, I cross checked different sections, specifically yearly change, percentage change, and color conditionals, with public repositories on GitHub (looking up similar examples of functions), as well as with two other classmates.
To work on the looping feature, which is the last condition of the assignment, I had the help of a tutor through BootCamp.
